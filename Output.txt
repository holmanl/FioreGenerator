Here starts the book on dueling and fighting called the Flower of
Battles with harness and without, on horse and on foot, composed by me
Fiore de' Liberi of Cividale d'Austria in the Diocese of Aquileia, son
of Sir Benedetto of the noble house of the Liberi.  To all
those who want to learn how to handle weapons on foot and on horse,
Fiore from Friuli de' Liberi from Cividale d'Austria in the Diocese of
Aquileia, son of Sir Benedetto, wishes health in the Lord and a good
result to all their endeavors. 

Because I was attracted by a natural desire, since adolescence, to the
practice of combat, I applied myself very diligently, with the passing
years, to the many secrets of the art of fighting with the sword, the
spear, the dagger, and also unarmed, on foot and on horse. 
Thanks to God, I received all this knowledge from various teachers and
from lessons from expert masters from Italy and Germany, and in
particular from Master Giovanni called Suveno, who was a scholar of
Nicolo' from Metz, and from many Princes, Dukes, Counts and many others
in diverse places and provinces. 
And so, taking a break from the practical exercises, in order to avoid
that this martial discipline, which is of so great assistance to expert
people in war and any other occasion, wouldn't get lost and forgotten,
I have decided to write a book about the aspects more useful and
refined of such an art, drawing on it pictures and adding some
examples, thanks to which the armed man and the wrestler can make use
of techniques and cunnings both for attack and defense.  Moreover, any nobleman who studies this work of ours should
take great care for it as it were a treasure, so that it will not be
divulged among the peasantry, which Heaven created dull and only for
the use of heavy work, like animals of burden. Therefore, one must keep
this precious and secret science away from them and bring it to Kings,
Dukes, Princes, Barons and other noblemen entitled to duelling.
No one should think that in this book there are false or erroneous
concepts because, eliminating the ambiguities, I have described in it
only techniques that I have invented, or seen, or tried. 
Let us then start our work with the help of the Omnipotent, whose Name be blessed and praised through the centuries.  Amen. On the tenth day of February of the year 1409, I, Fiore de' Liberi
from Friuli, Cividale in Austria, son of Sir Benedetto of the house of
de' Liberi, started this treatise on fighting with weapons and
hand-to-hand combat: that is with spear, poleax, sword, and dagger, and
wrestling, on foot and on horse, with harness and without, and other
things pertaining to fighting. And of all these things we will explain
action and counter action, so that one will follow the other.
And this treatise will recite our entire knowledge and intentions of
what we have seen from many masters and scholars and warriors and
Dukes, and Princes, Marquis, Counts, Knights and Esquires and many more
people from diverse provinces, and also things that we discovered
ourselves. These include: guards with all weapons and tricks and
defenses and hitting and grabbing and tying and breaking and
dislocating arms and legs and torsions and injuries in the most
dangerous places, according to the desire of the master of this art.
Since it is difficult to keep in one's mind this complicated art without
written books, and since there will never be a good scholar without
books, how can one become a good teacher? I have seen a thousand people
calling themselves masters, of which perhaps four were good scholars,
and of those four scholars not one would be a good teacher.
And so, our treatise will comprise all of our knowledge, as a book
decorated with figures painted on it, with explanations from number to
number. The mentioned painted figures will be distinguishable in the
following manner. The masters, who start their techniques, will wear a
golden crown on their head, while their scholars, who will counter
these techniques, will wear a golden ribbon under the knee. The
masters, who will counter the techniques started by other masters, will
wear a golden crown on their head and a golden ribbon under the knee.

Each technique will have its explanatory caption, and all the captions
and the whole painted book will be dedicated to the most Illustrious
and Excellent Sir Nicholo', Marquis of the city of Ferrara and of the
city of Modena and Parma and other cities. 
And in this book, we will talk about all of our knowledge.  First we
will talk about wrestling on foot and then about other things on
fighting with weapons according to what you will see painted and sorted
in this anthology. Who wants to succeed in the use of weapons should study this book, which was made by Fiore: which book is called the Flower of Battles.

This book will display all labors of war,
that is with spear, poleax, sword, dagger and wrestling
on horse, on foot, with harness and without and 
how it should be done. 
And you will see grabs, ties and breaks
and styles and measures of combats.
And having examined the book, you can very well 
believe all other things which you will see in it.
For I have studied this art for fifty years:
who can learn more in a shorter time will have a good deal.
And we will start with the wrestling part in the name of God and Sir Saint George, the Good Knight. 

 Wrestling
needs seven things, which are: physical strength, agility of feet and
arms, advantageous holds, breaks, ties and percussions and injuries,
according to what you will see in the painted figures, particularly in
techniques that will gain holds, each one with its own knowledge and
cunning. Because, in techniques that are only for practice, the holds
are holds of love, and not holds of anger. Regarding the art of
wrestling to gain holds, sometimes you do it for anger and sometimes
for your life, and these are techniques that you can't practice with
courtesy, even if they are techniques dangerous to practice. And here
you will find Wrestling on foot to gain holds, and again holds made for
practice. 

Four crowned masters, who are masters of the dagger and of the art pertaining to the dagger.


Four with seven swords, which mean the seven strikes with the sword.
A master against three scholars, who practice the sword without the buckler.
 A
master with a club and with a dagger against a man, who has a spear. A
master with two clubs and with a dagger against a man who has a spear.
The guards of the spear, which are six masters: the first three masters
practice from the right side, the other three practice from the left
side. Two kings with two swords waiting to be attacked with spears and
swords and who wait with the corresponding guards. Two ways of
disarming a man armed with a spear.

A man with seven swords around him [and] the meaning of this figure and the swords.
Six crowned masters with six swords, and one does not carry a sword.
Twelve crowned masters, one after the other, standing with the sword on guard.
Two masters crossing the sword, who start wounding with an arm's length combat the throat of the opponent.
Two other crowned masters who practice three arm's length combat.
Another crowned master, who has twelve scholars, who do their practices and the first practice is a villain's hit.

And then, after these twelve techniques, a contrary one, who will stick
the tip of the sword in the face of the opponent. Two crowned masters
crossing their mid swords, who can use all techniques according to whom
is better than the other. Among the techniques of these two masters
with their crossed swords, you will find five other masters fighting at
close range, trying to steal each other sword and they are better with
weapons than without, although they are good at both, that is with
weapons and without. A crowned master crossing another the opposite
way, and after they do their two techniques. And a crowned master who
makes a contrary one. And a master holding a man under his arm, to
throw him to the ground, him and his sword. Four students doing four
techniques, and here ends the technique of the two-hand sword.

You will find six crowned masters, sword in hand, who stand on guard and
counter guard ready to engage according to the following ten
techniques. And then four masters with four poleaxes on guard and
counterguard, which masters can practice five techniques, and also
other with the sword, which I'll mention later.

You will find fighting with the lance, and a lance against another lance
on horse, and a lance against a spear, and again a sword against a
spear in different ways. And then sword against sword, and how to grab
the sword from a man on a horse and throw him down in different ways,
one way and the contrary. And bare arms techniques in different ways.
And you will see a man wanting to throw another man and his horse to the
ground. And a man wanting to grab the reins from the hands of another
man. And a crowned master on foot with a spear in his hands, and what
he can do with the spear he could do with a lance, with a club and also
with a sword, and he waits three people on horse: the first has the
lance under his arm, the second has it rested on his shoulder, the
third is poised to throw the lance at the master, who is able to do the
two techniques that follow.
And then you will find a crowned master on horse with the lance rested
on his shoulder riding toward another to cross the top of the lances,
which master has a rope tightened to his lance.  The rope ends on the
saddle of his horse and is four arms long, or more, and with this lance
he wants to wound the opponent, or throw the lance at his neck and drag
him down from the horse. 
 You
will find a crowned master with a dagger in his hand waiting two
opponents, one by one, with swords against him and you will see his
techniques. And then actions of sword against dagger, which I'll insure
are clearly understood through the written words, that is, the
captions. And then a very insidious poleax, used in a way that with the
first shot at his face, the opponent having received the shot, loses
his eyesight in a way that it will be difficult for him to see ever
again. 
And then you will find a crowned master with a poleax in his hand, who
has thrown a rope tight to the cap of the poleax, which cap is one
pound or more heavy, around the legs of his opponent: and pulling the
poleax, he will pull the opponent to the ground.


And above all the mentioned techniques [there are] captions, worded in such a way as to be clearly understood. 
             I, Fiore, beg my Sir Marquis that the book be recommended because
you will never find another one like it, nor you will find masters
capable of such a book, and also, for the long time it took me to
prepare it, I'm not going to make another one so big as this one;
because through my faith, it took me half a year to finish it, so long
that I don't want anymore such burdens, given the old age that
aggravates me. May God watch over Sir Marquis Nichollo' da Este,
Master of the city of Ferrara, of the city of Modena, of the city of
Parma and the lands around them.My, friend, if you want to know the practice of the weapons, bring with you all that this book teaches. Be audacious in the attack and let your soul not be old.
Have no fear in your mind; be on guard, you can make it.

Take the woman for an example, fearful and stricken by panic,
she would never face the naked steel.
And so a fearful man is worth less than a woman.
If you don't have audacity of heart, all else is missing.
Audacity, such virtue is what this art is all about.

SECTION 1 : WRESTLING


Let's first start in the name of God and of Sir Saint George with
wrestling on foot to gain holds. Holds are not gained if they don't
have an advantage. But we, four masters, are looking for advantageous
holds, as you can see in the painting.



    	
  
I'm ready to gain my holds,  If I don't trick you, you'll have a deal.
 
I try to change my fight,  And with this one I'll throw you to the ground.



    	
  
If you won't beat me with your cunning, I believe   
That with my strength I'll hurt you, and worse.
 
I come forth with my arms well forward   To gain my holds in any way I can.



    	
  
With this hold I'll throw you to the ground,  Or else I'll dislocate your left arm.
 
With your mouth I'll make you kiss the ground,  Or I'll make you enter in the key below.



    	
  
I'll make you fall to the ground on your back   And I won't let you get up without pain.
 
Even if you were a master of wrestling,   I would throw you to the ground with this hold.



    	
  
With the hold I have above and below    I'll break your head on the ground.
 
With my hands well put on your face,   I will show you other holds.



    	
  
Because of my head which I have put under your arm,    
With little effort I will throw you to the ground.
 
Because of the finger I keep under your left ear,  
I see that the hold you had on me is failing.



    	
  
With great cunning you grabbed me from behind,  
And this hold will for sure throw you to the ground.
 
This wrestling is to trip you up,  Of the five, not one is successful.



    	
  
This is for sure a hold for practice,  For I can block you without hurt.
 
I'll hit your groins so hard,  That you'll lose all your strength.



    	
  
I'll give your nose so much pain and suffering  That you'll want to leave right away.
 
It's true that I left you from this grab  And with this counter grab I'll floor you.



    	
  
Under the chin I give you pain and suffering,  
And quickly on your back you'll hit the ground.
 
With your hands on my face you bother me,  As a counter move I bother your eye even more.



    	
  
With a stick I've tied your neck,  If I don't floor you, you'll have a bargain.
 
If you don't go to the ground with this stick  I'll never believe this to be a true art.

SECTION 4 : STAFF AND SPEAR



   
  
This way I wait with the dagger and the staff: The staff will protect,
the dagger will hit your chest; And what I do with the staff I would do
with the sword, Although the sword would be stronger. 
In the way the master has just said, In that way I'll hit your chest.



   
  
I'll wait for you here with a dagger and two clubs: I throw one at you,
with the other I come close to you And right away with the dagger I'll
hit your chest. 
And what the master has said, that I will do, And the dagger I'll put in your chest.



           
The guards of the spear, which are six masters: 
the first three masters practice from the right side, 
the other three practice from the left. 

The long spear, which is used by hand,
The longer it is, the less it's deceiving: 
Six master stay on guard with it
With one step and one strike right away they hit,
For sure from the right and also from the left: 
Striking is done outside on the street
And the strike wants an arm on the spear
And whoever does the contrary will fail. 

           


   
  
tutta porta de ferro destraI wait with this guard with a short spear: My habit is to strike and to exchange the point.

meza porta de ferroYour spear is long and short is mine: Don't try to run, or I'll humiliate you.



   
  
nobele posta di finestra destraWith my spear I'll strike yours in passing And right away I'll thrust it in your chest.

Such is the wounding by the three former masters, 
And in such a way that their spear will end in your face or chest.



           
We are three masters who will fight in reverse:
One after another comes who wants to come, and we'll hurt him;
The fourth master will complete the art of our fights
And we gave him his fair share of the crown.

           


   
  
posta di denti chingialeThis guard will suffice me against any spear, I
cover myself above and below with steps and returns, With the butt of
the ground and the tip on top I have no problem covering and hitting.

Throw, that I want to thrust my spear in your chest.



   
  
posta di finestra sinistraI will finish you without failing when turning around because I'm the master of all changes.

And here ends the art of the spear, With harness and without, this one is supreme.



 

We are two masters waiting to throw, Doesn't matter if spears, arrows or swords, 
And we make defense with the sword And the same we'll do with the staff; 
With steps and returns Cuts and thrusts we'll use; And even Pulicano, 
who I know was a good spear fighter, Wouldn't gain honor against us.



   
  
If I want to get this spear off me, I'd better hit it hard from above,
So that I'll break the staff of your spear And then I'll feel like doing a close combat.

With my arms, this way I'll get rid of your spear, then I'll turn and hit you,
And if I can't make this way Then I'll use the technique I described before.

SECTION 5 : LONG SWORD



           
The Sign of the Sword 

The figure below portrays the symbols of the four virtues necessary for fencing. 

Two are technical virtues and two are moral:
The sense of measure and the choice of timing (Prudentia, represented by a lynx),
Speed of action (Celeritas, represented by a tiger),
Courage (Audatia, represented by a lion),
Physical and psychological strength (Fortitudo, represented by an elephant).

The seven swords represent seven types of strikes: 
two fendenti, or strikes from the top,
two sottani, or strikes from bottom,
two mezzani, or strikes from the side and
a thrust, with the corresponding seven basic guards to neutralize them.



           



           
We are six masters, different one from the other:
One does one way, the others another;
And each keeps his sword on guard:
And we'll show what they are about.

           


    	
  
I'm well prepared for the throw, And I'll make a good deal from a great pass.
 
Against a throw I hide my hand With this guard I'm well defended.



    	
  
To push farther and stronger This position I want against a man in arms.
 
Against dagger and sword armed and unarmed, I want to be found like this.



    	
  
This grip is the guard of the proud woman: It protects against any strikes and thrusts.
 
This sword I use for a sword and an axe: With harness and without who can take me, go ahead.



           
Twelve crowned masters 
We are called post and guards by name 
And we are one contrary to the other; 
And depending on how we stand or are positioned 
We'll show how one stands against the other.

           


    	
  
I'm the WHOLE IRON DOOR at ground level And always stop cuts and thrusts.
 
I'm the GUARD OF THE WOMAN high and proud 
For all manner of defense And he who wants to counter me 
Should find a longer sword than mine.



    	
  
I'm the ROYAL GUARD OF THE TRUE WINDOW And I'm the quickest of the whole art.
 
I'm the strong HALF IRON DOOR And I kill with strikes and thrusts 
And for the length of the sword which I feel I always defend myself in close fight.



    	
  
I am the LONG GUARD with my short sword And with my talent I often cut a throat.
 
I'm the frontal guard and I'm called CROWN And don't forgive anybody a thrust or a cut.



    	
  
Again I'm the GUARD OF THE WOMAN  against the boar's tooth 
With my malice  and cunning I will fight you.
 
I am the strong GUARD OF THE BOAR'S TOOTH:  
And I can measure myself against all other guards.



    	
  
I am the SHORT GUARD and am as long as  the sword; 
I often thrust and quickly return to it.
 
I am the LEFT GUARD OF THE TRUE WINDOW 
And I'm quick with the right and the left.



    	
  
I am the GUARD OF THE LONG TAIL 
extended to the ground, I can offend forwards 
and backwards And if I step forward with a thrust 
Without failing I enter into close combat.
 
I am called the GUARD OF THE UNICORN, And don't ask me how cunning and false I am.



    	
  
To cross with you the tip of the sword, On the other side I stopped the tip in the chest.
 
To the wounding the way the previous master says, 
I quickly thrust the tip of the sword in your throat.



    	
  
Let's cross the middle sword and I'll wound your left arm 
And I'll do it quickly because time is short.
 
For the master who crosses the middle sword,  Of what he said, I'll do to you in abundance.



    	
  
After this crossing I want to grab your sword this way:
And before yours sword gets off my hand I'll hit you like a weak villain.
 
There is no question about what the master said before,
And the technique he explained, I'll do with reason.



    	
  
By dodging I have well opened you And for sure I'll hit your arms by turning.
 
I do a combat to hit your arms And from close combat I'll hit you more.



    	
  
When one wants to hit your leg with the sword, Strike his head or his throat;
Or hit the arms rather the head, Because the distance is shorter.
 
When I cross the swords and come to close distance. I'll hit his groins with my right foot.



    	
  
This is a cruel exchange of the tip: In this art you can't have a more cunning tip.
You traded tips and this I gave you, And I can make it safer by dodging
 
Thanks to my grip on your hand, With the tip I make a mark on your face.



    	
  
I quickly kick your tip to the ground And this way I'll hit you without any doubt.
 
And here we stay crossing on the ground, Ready to learn more techniques.



    	
  
For the crossing on the ground made by the scholar, 
For my swiftness I come to cut your face, And your sword will be bent or broken
And you won't use it for anything.
 
From last technique I enter into this one: And it will take me nothing to cut your face.



    	
  
By pinching your elbow I'll make you turn And in that I'll wound you without delay.
 
By turning you with the elbow I right away hit your head from behind.



    	
  
I pretended to attack from the right, I came from the left 
To give you pain and trouble with this tip; 
False tip I make myself called, I'm so cruel  And I change the tip of the sword.
 
For the false tip with which you wanted to hit me, 
I turn around and with my sword I hit you, 
And I put the tip on your face 
And I took away from you all your advantage.



    	
  
For the way we are here crossing our swords, 
Following are techniques with more knowledge and speed; 
And since many techniques start from this crossing, 
We are going to do the strongest contraries.
 
Because I grabbed your sword with my hand I'll hit you and your sword will be mine.



    	
  
Because my sword has received a hit and because of 
my grab, I'll hit your face with my pommel.
 
And this is another hit with my pommel, According to the art and the speed of the masters.



    	
  
I'll throw you to the ground this way: I did not miss putting my sword to your neck.
 
In my hand I have the grip with which I'll floor you with your sword.



    	
  
After a right parry I grabbed you in such a way That I'll floor you long and straight.
 
I entangled your sword with my arm, And I stuck the tip of my sword into our face, 
And this is the contrary to disarming me And other close range combats too.



    	
  
I grabbed your arms with my left arm And my technique is good armed 
and unarmed; And I can also steal away your sword,
According to where master Fiore puts me.
 
I have blocked the hilt of your sword in such a way,
That I can hit you with hits and thrusts;
I can also grab your sword away: I can hit you, but you can't touch me.



    	
  
I have tied you so well in this way,  That you would be blocked armed or unarmed 
And your sword would do nothing against me, But I can for sure take your sword away.
 
I have locked your hand with my sword And I'll hit your head with many hits, 
And I'll grab your sword from the middle, This tie I made, which is great.



    	
  
This is the left guard, For very cunning techniques.
 
From the left guard I have blocked your hand, And 
from close range you won't be protected from my hits.



    	
  
This is a strong grab with the left hand, You will be hit and your sword lost.
 
You wanted to block my sword under your arm But my contrary will make you have a bad ending.



    	
  
From the right guard I've grabbed you in such a way, 
That my sword will be in your face and you on the floor.
 
This grabbing of the sword is called the upper grab 
And was done a thousand time by Fiore from Friuli.



    	
  
Here I show the middle grab of the sword, 
And I'll cause trouble with your sword or mine.
 
This is the low grab of the sword: Who is master of this art, will do it well.



    	
  
This sword I'll keep as mine,  And with 
turning  and grabbing I'll cause you villainy.
 


 

 







           
The Sign of the Sword 

The figure below portrays the symbols of the four virtues necessary for fencing. 

Two are technical virtues and two are moral:
The sense of measure and the choice of timing (Prudentia, represented by a lynx),
Speed of action (Celeritas, represented by a tiger),
Courage (Audatia, represented by a lion),
Physical and psychological strength (Fortitudo, represented by an elephant).

The seven swords represent seven types of strikes: 
two fendenti, or strikes from the top,
two sottani, or strikes from bottom,
two mezzani, or strikes from the side and
a thrust, with the corresponding seven basic guards to neutralize them.



           



           
We are six masters, different one from the other:
One does one way, the others another;
And each keeps his sword on guard:
And we'll show what they are about.

           


    	
  
I'm well prepared for the throw, And I'll make a good deal from a great pass.
 
Against a throw I hide my hand With this guard I'm well defended.



    	
  
To push farther and stronger This position I want against a man in arms.
 
Against dagger and sword armed and unarmed, I want to be found like this.



    	
  
This grip is the guard of the proud woman: It protects against any strikes and thrusts.
 
This sword I use for a sword and an axe: With harness and without who can take me, go ahead.



           
Twelve crowned masters 
We are called post and guards by name 
And we are one contrary to the other; 
And depending on how we stand or are positioned 
We'll show how one stands against the other.

           


    	
  
I'm the WHOLE IRON DOOR at ground level And always stop cuts and thrusts.
 
I'm the GUARD OF THE WOMAN high and proud 
For all manner of defense And he who wants to counter me 
Should find a longer sword than mine.



    	
  
I'm the ROYAL GUARD OF THE TRUE WINDOW And I'm the quickest of the whole art.
 
I'm the strong HALF IRON DOOR And I kill with strikes and thrusts 
And for the length of the sword which I feel I always defend myself in close fight.



    	
  
I am the LONG GUARD with my short sword And with my talent I often cut a throat.
 
I'm the frontal guard and I'm called CROWN And don't forgive anybody a thrust or a cut.



    	
  
Again I'm the GUARD OF THE WOMAN  against the boar's tooth 
With my malice  and cunning I will fight you.
 
I am the strong GUARD OF THE BOAR'S TOOTH:  
And I can measure myself against all other guards.



    	
  
I am the SHORT GUARD and am as long as  the sword; 
I often thrust and quickly return to it.
 
I am the LEFT GUARD OF THE TRUE WINDOW 
And I'm quick with the right and the left.



    	
  
I am the GUARD OF THE LONG TAIL 
extended to the ground, I can offend forwards 
and backwards And if I step forward with a thrust 
Without failing I enter into close combat.
 
I am called the GUARD OF THE UNICORN, And don't ask me how cunning and false I am.



    	
  
To cross with you the tip of the sword, On the other side I stopped the tip in the chest.
 
To the wounding the way the previous master says, 
I quickly thrust the tip of the sword in your throat.



    	
  
Let's cross the middle sword and I'll wound your left arm 
And I'll do it quickly because time is short.
 
For the master who crosses the middle sword,  Of what he said, I'll do to you in abundance.



    	
  
After this crossing I want to grab your sword this way:
And before yours sword gets off my hand I'll hit you like a weak villain.
 
There is no question about what the master said before,
And the technique he explained, I'll do with reason.



    	
  
By dodging I have well opened you And for sure I'll hit your arms by turning.
 
I do a combat to hit your arms And from close combat I'll hit you more.



    	
  
When one wants to hit your leg with the sword, Strike his head or his throat;
Or hit the arms rather the head, Because the distance is shorter.
 
When I cross the swords and come to close distance. I'll hit his groins with my right foot.



    	
  
This is a cruel exchange of the tip: In this art you can't have a more cunning tip.
You traded tips and this I gave you, And I can make it safer by dodging
 
Thanks to my grip on your hand, With the tip I make a mark on your face.



    	
  
I quickly kick your tip to the ground And this way I'll hit you without any doubt.
 
And here we stay crossing on the ground, Ready to learn more techniques.



    	
  
For the crossing on the ground made by the scholar, 
For my swiftness I come to cut your face, And your sword will be bent or broken
And you won't use it for anything.
 
From last technique I enter into this one: And it will take me nothing to cut your face.



    	
  
By pinching your elbow I'll make you turn And in that I'll wound you without delay.
 
By turning you with the elbow I right away hit your head from behind.



    	
  
I pretended to attack from the right, I came from the left 
To give you pain and trouble with this tip; 
False tip I make myself called, I'm so cruel  And I change the tip of the sword.
 
For the false tip with which you wanted to hit me, 
I turn around and with my sword I hit you, 
And I put the tip on your face 
And I took away from you all your advantage.



    	
  
For the way we are here crossing our swords, 
Following are techniques with more knowledge and speed; 
And since many techniques start from this crossing, 
We are going to do the strongest contraries.
 
Because I grabbed your sword with my hand I'll hit you and your sword will be mine.



    	
  
Because my sword has received a hit and because of 
my grab, I'll hit your face with my pommel.
 
And this is another hit with my pommel, According to the art and the speed of the masters.



    	
  
I'll throw you to the ground this way: I did not miss putting my sword to your neck.
 
In my hand I have the grip with which I'll floor you with your sword.



    	
  
After a right parry I grabbed you in such a way That I'll floor you long and straight.
 
I entangled your sword with my arm, And I stuck the tip of my sword into our face, 
And this is the contrary to disarming me And other close range combats too.



    	
  
I grabbed your arms with my left arm And my technique is good armed 
and unarmed; And I can also steal away your sword,
According to where master Fiore puts me.
 
I have blocked the hilt of your sword in such a way,
That I can hit you with hits and thrusts;
I can also grab your sword away: I can hit you, but you can't touch me.



    	
  
I have tied you so well in this way,  That you would be blocked armed or unarmed 
And your sword would do nothing against me, But I can for sure take your sword away.
 
I have locked your hand with my sword And I'll hit your head with many hits, 
And I'll grab your sword from the middle, This tie I made, which is great.



    	
  
This is the left guard, For very cunning techniques.
 
From the left guard I have blocked your hand, And 
from close range you won't be protected from my hits.



    	
  
This is a strong grab with the left hand, You will be hit and your sword lost.
 
You wanted to block my sword under your arm But my contrary will make you have a bad ending.



    	
  
From the right guard I've grabbed you in such a way, 
That my sword will be in your face and you on the floor.
 
This grabbing of the sword is called the upper grab 
And was done a thousand time by Fiore from Friuli.



    	
  
Here I show the middle grab of the sword, 
And I'll cause trouble with your sword or mine.
 
This is the low grab of the sword: Who is master of this art, will do it well.



    	
  
This sword I'll keep as mine,  And with 
turning  and grabbing I'll cause you villainy.

SECTION 6 : FIGHTING IN ARMOUR



           
We are six guards ready to give battle, 
Because we completely know that art, 
And this art includes the complete truth: 
Poleax, sword and dagger to great extreme. 
And here we'll explain how this art happens: 
Masters and students will do it without lying. 

           


   
  
I'm the short guard, the snake, I have a sharp point to go through harnesses.

From the master's parry comes this thrust, And the next techniques that well follow.



   
  
You will go to the ground for the weak of my sword, 
And you'll be lucky if I don't do you worse.

And so hard that the harness won't protect you.

SECTION 6 : FIGHTING ON HORSE



           
I am the noble weapon called lance: 
I am always used at the beginning of the battle.  And he who looks 
at me with my flag Will lose all his courage because of fear:
And if I do my duty right away, Then I don't have to worry about poleax, sword or dagger.

           


    	
  
I don't have to worry about poleax, sword or dagger.
 
I carry my lance like the tooth of a wild boar, To deflect yours and enter with mine.



    	
  
Like the tooth of a wild boar I carry my lance: Deflect and hit is always my habit.
 
So that you won't have an advantage on me with your lance, 
I'll bring my lance to the same side as yours.



    	
  
 
Because I have a spear, I come to you with the woman's guard:
And I'm quite sure I'll deflect and hit.



    	
  
To damage you or your horse I'll do this throw And then I'll visit you with my sword.
 



    	
  
 
In running away I have no other defense But turning around and hit you.



    	
  
I'll do the contrary to your guard: And I'll hit your horse with no problems.
 



    	
  
 
I will deflect your lance with my sword: Then I'll hit you with a strike or a thrust.



    	
  
 
So that you won't deflect my lance, I will hold it under my left arm.



    	
  
I approach you with half lance And you'll be slower in 
deflecting my lance. I believe I'll hit your horse without failing: 
And you'll see my technique come to pass as follows.
 



    	
  
So that you wont engage your sword with me, I carry my lance low to hit your horse.
 



    	
  
Carrying the sword this way allows me to do four techniques,
I can hit with strikes and thrusts without failing; 
I can also throw from the horse and grab the sword: 
Rarely have I failed in these things.



    	
  
I make no comparison with these two guards: 
He who knows better, his opinion will win. 
And he who can watch for feigns, Will do those four techniques well.



    	
  
I gladly put this tip in your throat For the third master who shows this guard.
 
This is an equal engaging without advantages:
He who knows cunning arts, should start using them.



    	
  
For the first master who is on guard with his sword,I gave you this hit on the head.
 
After engaging your sword I pushed it aside, And with mine I gave you a big hit,
And I could have hit you with the tip: The defense you have would not have stopped me.



    	
  
You will lose your sword with this grip Or you will go to the ground defenseless.
 
So that my sword is not taken away I did the contrary this time; 
And what you wanted to do to me With the contrary I will do to you.



    	
  
You will be thrown from the horse to the ground, Then I'll know what to do with you.
 
If I'm going to be unsaddled, I can't do any other defense than this hit.



    	
  
I want to use cuts and thrusts in my defense, 
If my sword has not been taken from me, 
And if I haven't been thrown from the horse 
I will hit your face with the pommel without failing.
 
To avoid you hitting my face with the pommel Keeping my sword steady I will avoid your hit.



    	
  
The way I grabbed you coming from behind, I will throw you from the horse, this I do believe.
 
You wanted to throw me from the horse But with this contrary I will throw you to the ground.



    	
  
I want to lift your leg with the stirrup, And you'll get thrown to the ground.
 
You wanted to throw me from the horse: But with this contrary you will be thrown.



    	
  
If I want to throw your horse to the ground, 
I'll have my horse put his chest on the neck of yours; 
I won't let your horse bit go 'till you'll go to the ground with him; 
This is a good technique for one with the harness, because no weapon can hurt him.
 
I try to grab the reins from your hands And pull them over the head of your horse: 
And after the reins are pulled over his head I'll lead you to another country.



    	
  
Even if Roland and Publicano came to me with a lance, 
I would wait for them this way with a chiavarina or a club; 
I will deflect the lance and hit their head, And I will start from this guard.



    	
  
With my chiavarina I'll cut your head From the guard of the master which is so fast.
 
I hit you with the foot of the chiavarina 
And I still keep a sharper point at the other end.



  
This master tied a rope to his saddle, And to the foot of his lance 
To throw it around the neck of his enemy, And drag him to the ground.


 

 







           
I am the noble weapon called lance: 
I am always used at the beginning of the battle.  And he who looks 
at me with my flag Will lose all his courage because of fear:
And if I do my duty right away, Then I don't have to worry about poleax, sword or dagger.

           


    	
  
I don't have to worry about poleax, sword or dagger.
 
I carry my lance like the tooth of a wild boar, To deflect yours and enter with mine.



    	
  
Like the tooth of a wild boar I carry my lance: Deflect and hit is always my habit.
 
So that you won't have an advantage on me with your lance, 
I'll bring my lance to the same side as yours.



    	
  
 
Because I have a spear, I come to you with the woman's guard:
And I'm quite sure I'll deflect and hit.



    	
  
To damage you or your horse I'll do this throw And then I'll visit you with my sword.
 



    	
  
 
In running away I have no other defense But turning around and hit you.



    	
  
I'll do the contrary to your guard: And I'll hit your horse with no problems.
 



    	
  
 
I will deflect your lance with my sword: Then I'll hit you with a strike or a thrust.



    	
  
 
So that you won't deflect my lance, I will hold it under my left arm.



    	
  
I approach you with half lance And you'll be slower in 
deflecting my lance. I believe I'll hit your horse without failing: 
And you'll see my technique come to pass as follows.
 



    	
  
So that you wont engage your sword with me, I carry my lance low to hit your horse.
 



    	
  
Carrying the sword this way allows me to do four techniques,
I can hit with strikes and thrusts without failing; 
I can also throw from the horse and grab the sword: 
Rarely have I failed in these things.



    	
  
I make no comparison with these two guards: 
He who knows better, his opinion will win. 
And he who can watch for feigns, Will do those four techniques well.



    	
  
I gladly put this tip in your throat For the third master who shows this guard.
 
This is an equal engaging without advantages:
He who knows cunning arts, should start using them.



    	
  
For the first master who is on guard with his sword,I gave you this hit on the head.

SECTION 8 : SWORD VS. DAGGER 



    	
  
With my dagger I know how to parry cuts and thrusts: 
If one by one you come I have an infallible game: 
And my scholar will prove it: And he'll do it according to the picture.
 
Proof is painted here: You can see  that I can hit you with no problem.



    	
  
Here, I win over the dagger with the sword, In that I have turned and pushed you.
 
If one wanted to hit my head with his sword, 
I quickly would do this parry: I would turn him with
my left hand, And hit him on the back with the dagger.



    	
  
To avoid you hitting my back  I'll do this contrary without any problem.
 
The game is dagger against sword: I invite the dagger against the sword, 
And I'll show through the scholar Which way this game can be done.



    	
  
In this manner does the sword defend against 
the dagger: I'll hit you with the sword: 
the dagger can do nothing.
 
This other one is a strange case: The dagger invites against the sword: 
The sword will do the game of the scholar And will show that the dagger can do nothing.



    	
  
I'll hit your eye with the scabbard  And I won't stop hitting you with the sword.
 



           

 A crowned master with a poleax in his hand,
