And of all these things we will explain\\r\\naction and counter action, so that one will follow the other.\\r\\nAnd this treatise will recite our entire knowledge and intentions of\\r\\nwhat we have seen from many masters and scholars and warriors and\\r\\nDukes, and Princes, Marquis, Counts, Knights and Esquires and many more\\r\\npeople from diverse provinces, and also things that we discovered\\r\\nourselves. These include: guards with all weapons and tricks and\\r\\ndefenses and hitting and grabbing and tying and breaking and\\r\\ndislocating arms and legs and torsions and injuries in the most\\r\\ndangerous places, according to the desire of the master of this art.\\r\\nSince it is difficult to keep in one\\'s mind this complicated art without\\r\\nwritten books, and since there will never be a good scholar without\\r\\nbooks, how can one become a good teacher? I have seen a thousand people\\r\\ncalling themselves masters, of which perhaps four were good scholars,\\r\\nand of those four scholars not one would be a good teacher.\\r\\nAnd so, our treatise will comprise all of our knowledge, as a book\\r\\ndecorated with figures painted on it, with explanations from number to\\r\\nnumber. The mentioned painted figures will be distinguishable in the\\r\\nfollowing manner. The masters, who start their techniques, will wear a\\r\\ngolden crown on their head, while their scholars, who will counter\\r\\nthese techniques, will wear a golden ribbon under the knee. The\\r\\nmasters, who will counter the techniques started by other masters, will\\r\\nwear a golden crown on their head and a golden ribbon under the knee.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach technique will have its explanatory caption, and all the captions\\r\\nand the whole painted book will be dedicated to the most Illustrious\\r\\nand Excellent Sir Nicholo\\', Marquis of the city of Ferrara and of the\\r\\ncity of Modena and Parma and other cities. \\r\\nAnd in this book, we will talk about all of our knowledge.
